# Sales Prediction
In this program, you will be using C++ programming constructs, such as cin, cout, arithmetic and assignment operators.

## main.cpp
CompanyX produced total sales of $2,103,419,277 in 2018. Their sales so far for 2019 show sales have increased by 18%.

Write a program that prints out last year's sales as well as the prediction for this year's sales, assuming this year's sales continue to show the 18% increase.

*Please use whole numbers only (i.e., integer data types, rather than floating point for this exercise).*

Define the following 2 constants in your program:
1. The percent by which sales have increased
2. Last year's total sales

# Hints
1. Make sure the data types you choose are large enough to hold the values that are assigned and calculated
1. Don't forget to add comments to explain what the code is doing
1. Choose variable names that explain the purpose of the variable

# Sample Output
```
Last year's sales were $2103419277
This year's sales prediction: $2482034746
```
