# Find the Errors
In this program, you will debug a program that contains the following:
1. Compile time bugs
2. Run time bugs
3. Style guide violations

## main.cpp
1. Visually inspect the code and fix any code statements that do not follow the style guide (e.g., spacing and indentation).
1. Try compiling the program to find out what errors the compiler finds.
1. Find and fix the compile time error(s).
1. Once the program compiles, try running it to see whether it outputs the expected results.
1. Find and fix any bug(s) in the program that are causing incorrect results to be output.

# Hints
1. The compiler outputs the line number and column of the error if a compile time error is encountered
   e.g., `main.cpp:27:37` indicates an error in your code on line 27, column 37
1. Make sure the result for average **includes the decimal digits**

# Sample Output
```
Enter three integers, each separated by one or more spaces: 33 36 37
The average of 33, 36, and 37 is: 35.3333
```
