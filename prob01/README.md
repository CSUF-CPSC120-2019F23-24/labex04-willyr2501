# Manipulating char, and data overflow
In this program, you will be learning to use the basic C++ programming constructs, such as cout, sizeof, dec, hex, and the ASCII character set, as well as viewing what happens with variable overflow.

## main.cpp
Find the statements marked "TODO" in the program, and follow the instructions found there.

# Hints
1. Make sure you have checked in your updates for all 5 "TODO" statements.
2. Optional: add code to check underflow and overflow for other data types, for instance *double*
